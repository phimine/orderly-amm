### 系统概述

一个可升级的AMM Defi协议，允许用户使用自动做市商(AMM)模型在ETH和多个ERC20代币之间进行交换。

### 功能拆解

#### 流动性池-交易对（支持以ETH与其他ERC20代币之间的交易对）

1. 提供流动性时获得LP token
2. 移除流动性时销毁LP token
3. 使用代币兑换其他代币（ERC20->ETH、 ETH->ERC20）

#### 交易对工厂

1. 创建交易对合约

#### 主路由合约

1. 用户质押ETH和ERC20提供流动性
2. 用户以LP Token为凭证移除流动性
3. 用户使用ETH兑换ERC20代币
4. 用户使用ERC20代币兑换ETH

### 状态变量

```
交易对合约 {
   // 交易对基础
   tokenA
   tokenB
   // 代币存量
   tokenA reserve
   tokenB reserve
   // 价格*时间
   tokenA priceCumulativeLast
   tokenB priceCumulativeLast
   // 工厂：只允许通过工厂创建和初始化
   factory
}
```

```
交易对工厂合约 {
    // 现存的交易对: tokenA => tokenB => pair
    getPair
}
```

```
主路由合约 {
    // 工厂：用于创建交易对
    factory
    // WETH：自动兑换ETH和WETH
    WETH
}
```

# Technical Requirement:

Title: Development of an Advanced, Secure, and Gas-Optimized AMM Platform
Objective:
Create a robust, upgradeable smart contract platform that allows users to swap between ETH and multiple ERC20 tokens using an Automated Market Maker (AMM) model. Implement advanced security features, optimize for gas efficiency, and ensure seamless upgradeability. Provide comprehensive testing, deployment strategies, and documentation.
Technical Requirements:

1. Smart Contract Development:
   o AMM Implementation:
    Develop an AMM that supports swapping between ETH and at least two ERC20 tokens.
    Implement liquidity pools, allowing users to add/remove liquidity and earn fees.
    [Optional] Include slippage control mechanisms and dynamic pricing based on pool reserves.
   o Advanced Access Control:
    Use role-based access control to manage different permissions within the contract.
    [Optional] Implement multi-signature requirements for critical functions.
2. Security Features:
   o Vulnerability Mitigation:
    Identify and protect against common vulnerabilities such as re-entrancy, overflow/underflow, denial of service, and access control issues.
   o Emergency Measures:
    Implement a circuit breaker or emergency stop function that can halt operations in case of detected anomalies.
   o Audit-Ready Code:
    [Optional] Write code that is structured and commented to facilitate third-party audits.
3. Upgradeability and Data Migration:
   o Complex Upgrades:
    Demonstrate upgrading the contract with changes in the storage structure, ensuring data integrity.
    Provide migration scripts and procedures.
   o Eternal Storage Pattern:
    [Optional] Utilize the Eternal Storage pattern to manage state separately from logic.
4. Gas Optimization:
   o Efficient Coding Practices:
    Optimize functions for minimal gas consumption, explaining the techniques used.
    Use events judiciously to balance between necessary logging and gas costs.
5. Testing and Quality Assurance:
   o Comprehensive Test Suite:
    Write extensive tests covering all functionalities, including unit tests, integration tests, and property-based tests.
   o Security Analysis:
    [Optional] Use static analysis tools to detect potential vulnerabilities.
6. Multi-Environment Deployment:
   o Provide scripts and instructions for deploying to different environments.
7. Documentation:
   o Include an architectural overview, detailed design rationale, and comprehensive user and developer guides.
